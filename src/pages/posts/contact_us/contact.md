  Cambridge Advisors Network proactively works to develop collaborative linkages
  among industry, academia and government to build relationships within the
  entrepreneurial ecosystem in Pakistan. We are a boutique consulting firm
  focused on helping firms develop products and services for relevant ant
  audiences in the context of the environment that we operate in. Our working
  philosophy is built around the triple helix model of integrating the three
  sectors to accelerate growth and innovation within sectors and for the larger
  economic and social benefits.


  ​


  We have been pioneers in this field having been the team behind running the MITEFP-Business Acceleration Plan from 2007-2015, University led programs such as Discover Prime Ministers Challenge that ran between 2011-2014 and IBA Invent which were huge successes. Additionally, we have worked to develop sector wise and district wise ecosystems such as the agribusiness ecosystem for SAU-Tando jam, IT ecosystem in tis nascent stages in association with MOITT and PSEB and HEC, IST for commercialization of research and others. Participating teams reported that they benefitted tremendously from participating in these competitions

description2: To mitigate the gaps in the national maritime domain, a need was
  felt to establish an informal yet professional research and outreach body to
  focus on the above aspects titled “Marine Echo”. The envisioned body named as
  “Maritime Study Forum (MSF)”, is established as an informal, independent, and
  non-partisan research institute dedicated to studying the emerging role of
  maritime in international relations, focusing on the Indian Ocean and beyond,
  and on issues having direct/indirect influence or significance for Pakistan.
  MSF is dedicated to generating meaningful dialogue, cutting edge research, and
  human development through engaging academia, media, civil society, policy
  practitioners, and opinion makers for the advancement of Pakistan’s maritime
  interests. MSF envisions itself as a leading platform for stakeholders in
  generating policy-oriented discourse on national, regional, and global
  maritime affairs domains
