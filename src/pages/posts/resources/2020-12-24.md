  We are in the business of sustainability. We leverage the wisdom of nature and
  use science to architect practical solutions to today’s problems.


  We conceive, research, develop, commercialize and invest in technologies that support a future with health and wellbeing for all.


  Our technologies span industries and applications from algae production systems to aquaponics, health, and biofuels. Our RiverBox™ technology is the world’s first modular, scalable and rapidly deployable biolfilm platform for the production of algal biomass. Our Algae-C technology provides low-cost full spectrum cannabinoids (major and minor) to the pharmaceutical industry. Our aquaponics technology offers a minimal footprint, closed-loop local food production system.
