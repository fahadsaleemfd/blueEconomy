  The Port of Seattle, in partnership with the Washington state Department of
  Commerce and consultants The Maritime Alliance, to study feasibility and plan
  for a Maritime Innovation Center at the historic Seattle Ship Supply building
  at the Fishermen's Terminal.


  A Center would be comprised of three programmatic elements:

  1) an incubator and/or business accelerator;

  2) active connections between local industry and academia within a focused maritime innovation network;

  3) education and training resources that would serve the maritime community.


  A model facility is anticipated to offer a spectrum of services while catalyzing innovation within communities. Check back for more information as it becomes available.
