  Transportation System
description: The unique freshwater resources of the Great Lakes fueled the
  regionâ€™s early development, with waterfront areas historically serving as
  centers of economic activity. However, the industrialization and development
  of the basin over the past 200 years has had an impact on the ecological
  health of the lakes. Currently, many coastal communities are working to
  restore and reclaim waterfronts and leverage fresh water assets to promote
  economic growth, support water-dependent industry, and sustain a high quality
  of life in the Great Lakes region.
