  The origins of the Blue Economy concept can be traced back to the mid 90’s,
  when the Belgian businessman turned author, Gunter Pauli, was asked by the
  United Nations to think about innovative business models of the future.


  Originally conceived with the aim of reconciling the shared goals of stimulating entrepreneurship whilst also preserving marine eco-systems, today, the term ‘Blue Economy’ covers a range potential policy interventions ranging from;


  Practical programmed for delivering any form of economic growth which is linked to the marine and maritime economy;


  More complex economic philosophies which draw on a range of ‘circular economy’ concepts and frameworks to deliver growth in such a way which preserves, maintains and enhances the marine environment (and therefore delivers more significant, long run benefits to society).
